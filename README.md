# Sociiity Project Overview

Sociiity represents my first end-to-end web app project, combining Django for the backend and React for the frontend.


## Media Storage:

Media storage for the project is implemented using AWS S3.

## Theme of app:

The project is centered around the concept of a social media platform designed for users to report and share incidents or concerns within their city.

## Functionalities:

1. **Account Creation/Login:**
   - Users can create accounts and log in.

2. **Upload Posts:**
   - Users can upload posts and tag them with location and category.
   - Upload media files, up to a maximum of 3.

3. **Feed:**
   - Access a basic news feed to view posts from users in the same city.

4. **Profile Edit:**
   - Users can edit their profile picture, name, and address.

5. **Search:**
   - Search for posts across the entire country.
   - Apply location filter to refine search results.

6. **Notifications:**
   - Receive basic notifications.

7. **View Single Post:**
   - Even if not logged in, users can view a single post.
   - If not logged in, a login button will be displayed.


## Repository Structure:

The project repository is organized into three main sub-directories:

1. **frontend**: Contains the React-based frontend implementation of Sociiity.
2. **backend**: Contains the Django-based backend code for Sociiity.
3. **docs-site**: contains the React-based documentation site for Sociiity.

## Note:

I built this project as a startup idea, meaning I had to make changes quickly. As a result, I could not maintain very high quality code.
